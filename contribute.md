- ### How To Contribute  
    - You need to choose a **problem statement** from codechef.
    - Once you choose a problem statement (making sure that it is not present in the repository already), **add a folder** for the problem statement in your forked repository.
    - This repository doesn't promote code in the root of the directory. Hence code has to be in sub-directory.
    - In the folder, there must be **2 files**
    - **README.md & main.py**
    - **README.md** to explain the **problem statement**, provide links for **further reference on the problem statement**, and also **mentioning the algorithm** that has been used in your code.
    - **main.py** implements code for the given problem statement using an algorithm that is explicitly mentioned in README.md.
    - Make sure the code is in **C++ or Python**
    - **These steps need to followed** while contributing **otherwise your your PR will be considered invalid.**

- ### Guidelines for Contribution
    1. **Fork** the Repository
    2. **Add, edit or enhance** code.
    3. **No duplication, repetition and spamming**. It will not lead to an accepted Pull Request.
    6. Once you are done with your contribution, **issue a PULL REQUEST**. The Maintainer may ask you for a few changes. Once everything seems good, your code will be pulled and added to the original Repository branch.
